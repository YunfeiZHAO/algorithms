        [Datadog]
        A string can be abbreviated by replacing any number of non-adjacent,
        non-empty substrings with their lengths. The lengths should not have leading zeros.
        
        For example, a string such as "substitution" could be abbreviated as (but not limited to):
        "s10n" ("s ubstitutio n")
        "sub4u4" ("sub stit u tion")
        "12" ("substitution")
        "su3i1u2on" ("su bst i t u ti on")
        "substitution" (no substrings replaced)

        The following are not valid abbreviations:
        "s55n" ("s ubsti tutio n", the replaced substrings are adjacent)
        "s010n" (has leading zeros)
        "s0ubstitution" (replaces an empty substring)
        Given a string word and an abbreviation abbr, return whether the string matches the given abbreviation.
        A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

            Ensure itâ€™s not '0' (leading zero is invalid).
            Parse the full number and jump that many characters in word.
            When we see a letter, we must match it exactly with the current letter in word.
