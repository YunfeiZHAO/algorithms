    When we need to sort and we have limited type of elements, we should think of bucket sort.
    BUCKET SORT:
    IDEA: 
        We have at most 24 * 60 = 1440 possible times.
        Instead of sorting the list (which is slow), just mark which times exist using a bool[1440] array.  
        --> That is bucket sort: you make an array where each index is a "bucket" that tracks whether a time appears.
    Algo: 
        1) Convert everything to minutes
        2) Use a boolean[1440] to track visited times (bucket sort)
        3) Linear scan to compute min diff between visited minutes
        4) Edge Case: circular time difference (last â†’ first)
